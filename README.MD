# GoPlayGround

Welcome to **GoPlayGround** – a personal space for experimenting with fun and educational ideas using the Go programming language!

This repository is meant to be a growing collection of small, creative projects written in Go. The goal is to explore Go's features and idioms through hands-on development, starting with simple concepts and gradually building up more complex tools or playful experiments.

## 🚀 What's Here So Far?

- **NodeList**: A basic implementation of a linked list in Go, inspired by the [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/generics/2) exercise on linked lists. It's a simple starting point, but a great way to understand Go's struct and pointer mechanics.

More projects and ideas will be added over time as inspiration strikes!

## 📚 Why?

The GoPlayGround exists to:

- Practice Go in small, focused ways
- Share and document learning experiences
- Try out random and possibly silly ideas in code
- Build a reference for others who enjoy learning by tinkering

## 🛠️ How to Run

To run the existing NodeList example:

```bash
go run main.go
